# _Mazes_

#### _An app for exploring the generation of mazes, 4.11.2016_
##### _Version 0.2_

### By _**Joseph Karasek**_

## Description

_This web app is designed to generate and solve mazes using a range of algorithms, as well as supply information about biases, pros, and cons of each method._

_The goal of this project is to explore algorithms and share my interest in mazes. This project is also intended to be a self guided lesson in implementing algorithms to both generate and solve mazes._

_The project was put together using Node.js with guidance from the book [Mazes for Programmers](https://pragprog.com/book/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers). The sample code from the book is provided in Ruby, and was translated by me into Javascript._


## Setup/Installation

#### System Requirements

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) w/ [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
2. [Bower](http://bower.io/)
3. [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)

#### Installation

* After cloning the repo, you will need to install dependencies...

    npm install

* Gulp is used to handle both building the site and launching a server to host the site...

    gulp serve

* If you would like to build the site without launching a local server, you may run...

    gulp buildAll

## Known Bugs

_This application is not fully designed and may have unknown bugs._

_There is a current known bug with the rendering code that causes faded "ghost" walls to appear at certain maze sizes. Mazes with dimensions that are divisible by 8 do not have these graphic bugs._

## To Do (coming in future versions)

Lots... stay tuned.
